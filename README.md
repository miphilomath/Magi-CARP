# Magi-CARP
Community At Random Places 

The project is generic for any community to use. The project started by the ILUGD members for themselves, but is available for anyone to fork and use it to their needs.
It uses Openstreet maps API and is forked from Sflc.in website and fsug.in website. 

**May the FOSS be with you!**
